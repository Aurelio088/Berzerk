# Berzerk

## Executive Summary

This is my version of the classic arcade game Berzerk, launched for Atari in the early 80's. The game brings a fun twist to the classics. Here, the player is a soldier with a special dragon spear to fight enemies. These bad guys also have dragon spears and will chase the player if they get too close.

The player can also pick up items that make them move faster. The goal is to get through mazes, beat the enemies, and grab items to go to the next level.

## Game Description

### Overview

In this new version of Berzerk, you play as a soldier who battles through mazes using a powerful dragon spear. Your enemies are monsters armed with their spears too, and they will chase you if you get close. As you navigate the mazes, you can collect items to speed up your movement. The aim is to make it through each maze, defeat the monsters, collect items, and move on to the next scene. It's a simple yet thrilling experience for anyone who enjoys fast-paced action and strategic gameplay.

### The Quest

Your mission is to stay alive while making your way through mazes filled with enemy monsters. Fighting off these foes, moving quickly through tricky spots, and not getting caught are all part of the adventure. Each level brings tougher monsters and more complex mazes. The real reward is getting through these challenges. Keep going to beat your high score and earn a top place on the leaderboard.

### Main Character

The main character is a soldier wearing a uniform and carrying a dragon spear. This spear is your primary weapon to combat the monsters, each wielding their own spears, who will chase you when you get close. As you advance through the game, you can also collect speed-boosting items to help navigate the mazes more swiftly. The soldier's perspective is seen from the third person, placing you right in the middle of the action as you take on challenging foes and intricate mazes.

Additional functionality includes pausing the game with the 'P' key, returning to the previous menu or screen with the 'Escape' key, and quitting the game with the 'Q' key. For debugging purposes or enhanced player experience, toggling collision visibility and the grid display can be done using the 'C' and 'G' keys respectively.
